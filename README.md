#Spam Detection with TensorFlow 3.0
This script uses TensorFlow 3.0 to train a machine learning model for spam detection using natural language processing techniques. The script takes in text data and outputs a likelihood that the text is spam.

#Requirements
TensorFlow 3.0 or higher
Python 3.x

#Dataset
The provided dataset is a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or not spam. It can be found in the data folder. All of the used data can be found [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bagavathypriya/spam-ham-dataset)

#Model
The model uses a combination of natural language processing techniques and machine learning to classify the text input as spam 'ham'. The model cannot be fine-tuned with additional data and re-training.

#Note
The provided model is trained on a dataset for emails, so the results may not be optimal for different types of text data. It is suggested to test the model with a more relevant dataset for better results.
